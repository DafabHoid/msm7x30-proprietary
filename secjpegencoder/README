Samsung JPEG hardware encoder wrapper library
Copyright (C) 2018 DafabHoid

This library is a open source replacement for the proprietary
libsecjpegencoder.so, which can be found on many older Smartphone systems
running Android (including the Samsung Galaxy S Plus).

This library is meant to work as an drop-in replacement for the original
closed-source variant and should also be ABI-compatible in a way that allows
existing proprietary binary libraries and executables to work with this library
without any difference, until all existing proprietary binary libraries and
executables have been replaced with open source code.

Please excuse the lack of documentation and code quality, as much of the
function interfaces and code have been inspired by the proprietary binary, which
lacks debugging information, header files and documentation.
